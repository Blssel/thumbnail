# Yahoo Screen video thumbnail dataset
This repository contains the video thumbnail dataset used in our CIKM 2016 paper **"To Click or Not To Click: Automatic Selection of Beautiful Thumbnails from Videos."** 

## Introduction
The dataset consists of 1,118 videos and their associated thumbnails collected from Yahoo Screen. The dataset can be used as a benchmark for automatic thumbnail extraction methods.

## The Data
This repository contains four directories. 

The directory `./videos` contains our dataset in the JSON and the TSV formats. Due to the copyright issues, we release public URLs of the videos and their thumbnails. 

The directory `./labels` contains the label information, i.e., the location of a thumbnail frame in a video. 

The directory `./code` and `./results` contain a MATLAB script and some prediction results for reproducing our results in the paper.
